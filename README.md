This program consists of a class "car" that has different attributes of a car like model , year of manufacture ,its speed , its position in the xy plane.
i have created methods that allows to increase , decrease the speed of the car , and inturn its posotion .

A boolean method is also ctreated that can detect whether two cars will collide or not. Another method allows us to know the time the two cars will take to collide.

Dummy variables are taken and some of the methods are called just to showcase how the program runs well for two cars car1 and car2.
